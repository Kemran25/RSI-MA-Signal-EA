# RSI + MA Trading System (Portfolio Sample)

This repository contains a sample trading system for MetaTrader 5, built to demonstrate MQL5 coding skills. It includes two components:
1.  A custom indicator (`RSI_MA_Signal.mq5`) that generates signals.
2.  An Expert Advisor (`RSI_MA_Trader.mq5`) that trades those signals.

## 1. The Indicator: `RSI_MA_Signal.mq5`

This indicator combines signals from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a Moving Average (MA) to find entry points.

* **Buy Signal:** Generated when RSI is above 50 **AND** the closing price is above the Moving Average.
* **Sell Signal:** Generated when RSI is below 50 **AND** the closing price is below the Moving Average.

The indicator plots arrows on the chart and provides signal buffers for the Expert Advisor.

## 2. The Expert Advisor: `RSI_MA_Trader.mq5`

This EA automatically trades the signals generated by the custom indicator.

* **How it works:** It uses the `iCustom()` function to call the `RSI_MA_Signal.mq5` indicator.
* **Entries:** It opens a new trade (Buy or Sell) when a new signal appears on the close of a bar.
* **Trade Management:** Includes basic Stop Loss, Take Profit, and a Magic Number for trade identification.

### Input Parameters (EA):
* `Lots`: Lot size for trades.
* `StopLoss`: Stop Loss in points.
* `TakeProfit`: Take Profit in points.
* `MagicNumber`: Unique ID for trades.
* *(Indicator parameters are managed inside the EA's `iCustom` call)*
